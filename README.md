Enhanced Free Energy Estimation for Ligand-Receptor Binding (2024 â€“ Present)
This project enhances the accuracy and efficiency of free energy predictions in ligand-receptor binding, akin to Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) methods. It uses expanded ensemble MD simulations with a custom 1/t-modified Wang-Landau algorithm to optimize sampling, prevent weight saturation, and improve convergence.

Key Features:

Implementation of the 1/t-modified Wang-Landau algorithm in GROMACS for adaptive sampling.
Optimization of phase transitions to enhance energy landscape exploration.
Validation against experimental binding affinities in benchmark systems (e.g., standard ligand-receptor pairs).
Integration with quantum mechanics and data-driven methods for structure-based drug design in biologics.


Applications: Drug discovery hypotheses, predictive modeling for therapeutics, and refinement of computational methodologies for reliable outcomes.
